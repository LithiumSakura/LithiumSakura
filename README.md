## Hello! Thanks for checking out my profile. 🐉

🎓 I'm currently studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Bournemouth University, hoping to become a Web Developer (maybe I'll do a MSc in Web Development 🤔). My favourite language is probably C# and I really love SQL.

During my studies I've undertaken a variety of different roles to enhance my interpersonal skills:
1. 🌸 **Student Ambassador:** where I've had the opportunity to work within different teams for the university, such as: Open days & events, Schools Liaison Partnership, UK Admissions Team (for Clearing), Future Students Enquiry Team, & Digital Marketing (including being on the Unibuddy platform).
2. 💬 **President & Class Manager of the Language Learning Society:** where I co-founded a community to help improve people's confidence in language learning while being affordable and accessible.
3. 🔰 **PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) Leader for Technology Foundation:** where I conduct weekly sessions as a senior student with Foundation year students, to be an extra point of contact as they settle into the university.
4. 📢 **Student Representative:** where I’ve had the privilege of attending meetings and representing not just my own but fellow students’ voices.


☕ I'm slowly becoming a coffee addict like [my dad](https://github.com/M1XZG).


Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Please enjoy my uploaded work and stay tuned for new works to come!
