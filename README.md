## Hello! Thanks for coming along to my profile. 🐉
☕ I'm slowly becoming a coffee addict like [my dad](https://github.com/M1XZG).

🎓 I'm currently studying BSc (Hons) Software Engineering at Bournemouth University, hoping to become a Data Scientist (maybe I'll do a MSc in Data Science). My favourite language is probably C# (because it’s the first language I learnt) and I really love SQL (I’ve been told I’m crazy, I’ll wear that badge with honour 😁).

During my studies I've undertaken a variety of different roles (paid and voluntary) to enhance my skills:
1. 🌸 **Student Ambassador:** I've had the opportunity to work with some amazing teams to broaden my capabilities:
    - **Open Days & Events:** Provide comprehensive campus tours and detailed descriptions of buildings and features.
    - **Unibuddy:** A platform where prospective students can chat to current students and ask questions about student life / perspective
    - **Schools Liaison Program:** Collaborate with staff to organise safe and engaging campus visits for young students (ages 10-18).
    - **Future Students Enquiry Team:** Offer well-informed advice to prospective students via email and phone.
    - **Digital Marketing:** Creating content for the BU Blog page, I mostly discuss what it’s like to be a Computing student as well as a Society President.
2. 📢 **Student Representative:** being among other student reps, I’ve had the privilege of attending meetings and representing students’ voices
3. 💬 **President of the Language Learning Society:** I’m incredibly proud of the committee for not only creating a new society but maintaining the idea of creating a community to help improve people’s confidence in learning languages.
4. 🔰 Soon to be **PAL (Peer Assisted Learning) Leader for Technology Foundation:**
    - The foundation year option all Computing & Informatics department undergraduate course have that feed into the 8 courses on offer

Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Please enjoy my uploaded work and stay tuned for new works to come!
